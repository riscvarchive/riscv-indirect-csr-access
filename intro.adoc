== Introduction

Smcsrind/Sscsrind is an ISA extension that extends the indirect CSR
access mechanism originally defined as part of the
https://github.com/riscv/riscv-aia[[.underline]#Smaia/Ssaia
extensions#], in order to make it available for use by other extensions
without creating an unnecessary dependence on Smaia/Ssaia.

This extension confers two benefits:


. It provides a means to access an array of registers via CSRs without
requiring allocation of large chunks of the limited CSR address space.

. It enables software to access each of an array of registers by index,
without requiring a switch statement with a case for each register.

[NOTE]
====
_CSRs are accessed indirectly via this extension using select values, in
contrast to being accessed directly using standard CSR numbers. A CSR
accessible via one method may or may not be accessible via the other
method. Select values are a separate address space from CSR numbers, and
from tselect values in the Sdtrig extension. If a CSR is both directly
and indirectly accessible, the CSR's select value is unrelated to its
CSR number._

_Further, Machine-level and Supervisor-level select values are separate
address spaces from each other. Although Machine-level and
Supervisor-level CSRs with the same select value may be defined by an
extension as partial or full aliases with respect to each other. This
typically would be done for CSRs that can be delegated from
Machine-level to Supervisor-level._

The machine-level extension *Smcsrind* encompasses all added CSRs and
all behavior modifications for a hart, over all privilege levels. For a
supervisor-level environment, extension *Sscsrind* is essentially the
same as Smcsrind except excluding the machine-level CSRs and behavior
not directly visible to supervisor level.
